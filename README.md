**Project Title**: Personalized Movie Recommendation System for Enhanced User Experience


**Project Overview:**
The Personalized Movie Recommendation System leverages machine learning algorithms to provide users with tailored movie suggestions based on their preferences, viewing history, and ratings. The goal is to enhance the user experience by offering highly relevant movie recommendations, increasing engagement, and helping users discover new films that match their tastes.


**Key Features:**
-User Profiling: The system collects user data such as movie ratings, genre preferences, and viewing history to create a personalized profile.

-Collaborative Filtering: Uses data from similar users to predict and recommend movies based on the ratings and preferences of users with similar tastes.

-Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the features of the movies themselves, such as genre, cast, director, and plot keywords.

-Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering methods to improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.

-User Interface: Provides an intuitive interface where users can rate movies, view recommendations, and explore new content.



**Technologies Used:**
-Programming Language: Python


-Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy

-Machine Learning: Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Hybrid Recommender Systems

-Database: SQL (for storing user preferences and movie data)

-Framework: Flask(for building a web interface)

-Api: OMDB



**Challenges Addressed**:
-Overcome the cold-start problem (new users or movies with insufficient data).

-Improve recommendation accuracy by using a hybrid filtering method to combine strengths of different algorithms.

-Optimize system performance for handling large datasets of movies and user interactions.



**Outcome:**
The project results in a highly personalized movie recommendation system that enhances the overall user experience, allowing for easier discovery of content tailored to individual preferences.
